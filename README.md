# Commuter

This is a silly little command line app written and ruby that tells you the time between two addresses. It screen scrapes this information from Google Maps.

I built this for a few reasons:

1. My commute fucking sucks
2. I often check on the time the commute will take because I like to know when my commute is going to fucking suck.
3. I wanted to play with the mechanize and commander gems. Both are fun, by the way.

## Installation

gem install commuter

## Usage

commuter --start 'street, city, state, zip' --dest 'street, city, state, zip'
